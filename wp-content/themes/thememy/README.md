## Synopsis

*Gulp + WordPress* is a blank slate WordPress theme for those Developers wishing to start a project with the bare minimum.

The theme has been built according to [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/). All functions, includes and templates are placed in their respective directory and divided into separate files accordingly.

*Gulp + WordPress* is packaged with Gulp v4 for watching, compiling, and minifying SCSS and JS files.

A selection of helpful mixins is also included, most of which are featured in [this useful article](http://zerosixthree.se/8-sass-mixins-you-must-have-in-your-toolbox/) by [@seb_ekstrom](https://twitter.com/seb_ekstrom).

You may also write your JavaScript in ES6 &ndash; The Gulp scripts task utilises [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), so you can use new syntax without worrying about browser support.

## Installation

Clone the project into `wp-content/themes` and rename it accordingly.

You‚Äôll want to update `style.css` in the theme root with all the relevant bits of information, as well as `assets/package.json` (specifically `name` and `author`) and lastly `assets/gulpfile.js` (change the `themePrefix` variable accordingly).

Now, in Terminal, `cd` into the `assets` directory and install the Gulp packages (if you haven't already installed Gulp, you‚Äôll need to [do so](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) first):

`npm install`

Once you have installed the packages, in Terminal and while still in the `assets` directory, run `gulp watch`. Note that you may want to run the default task (`gulp`) to do an initial build of the assets.  

SCSS files in `assets/scss/` are compiled and minified over to `assets/css`.

JavaScript files in `assets/js/scripts/` are uglified, concatenated and sent over to `assets/js/`.

> Note: If you would like to specify scripts per WordPress template (e.g. posts, pages etc.), you can tweak the `js` Gulp task to create separate JavaScript files.
